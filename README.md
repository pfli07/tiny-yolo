# Vehicl intelligent protection system for children
The “Intelligent Protection System for Children Detained in Vehicles” is based on ARC and FPGA heterogeneous platforms. Through smart sensor systems and image processing systems, the vehicle is equipped with intelligent environmental awareness, target detection, remote reminding, emergency assistance, and voice interaction capabilities. Automatically detect whether there are children in the car in a timely manner, promptly remind parents to rush back to deal with remotely, and the system is provided with a key to help and start the emergency help function from the time of danger. Considering this work as an intelligent vehicle-borne system, this system can also be used as an in-vehicle environment monitor during the daily driving process of the vehicle owner, real-time monitoring of environmental information such as formaldehyde, temperature, etc. in the vehicle and displaying and exceeding the notification, while the owner can voice Interactively check the interior environment of the vehicle and control some equipment in the car.

## Introduction
### Project context
With the rapid popularity of automobiles in the world, it brings great convenience to people and also brings many security risks. Among them, accidents caused by the parents’ negligence have caused children to be locked in cars. When the vehicle is parked, once the child is trapped in the vehicle for a long time, dehydration, heat stroke, high temperature, and even suffocation are easily caused by changes in the temperature inside the vehicle and the accumulation of harmful gases, and because the child does not have a certain self-rescue capability, Can not take appropriate measures, plus most of the windows posted a film, it is difficult for passersby to see the situation from inside.

According to statistics, from 1998 to 2017, there were 709 children in the United States who were confirmed to have died of high temperature and death from motor vehicles. On average, 37 children died each year. In recent years, there have been similar situations in China. It has important practical significance to solve the problem of children's safety in the vehicle.
